## My process

I replicated the suggested QR code component design for desktop and mobile using HTML and CSS. I referenced various tools and sites to complete the design and deployed it live through Github.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to link my website to external files. For example, linking my HTML to a CSS document, a favicon image, and open-source fonts and styles.

This was a great exercise in understanding and applying box properties, with padding and margin. I also learned about the flex-box property and aligned items inside a div container. This was trickier than I thought, and it gave me a good understanding of how images and containers function.

I also learned how to center components in a responsive website. Rather than assigning static properties, the image and container adjusts to varying desktop and mobile sizes.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to work more with responsive screens, especially adjusting text and image sizes. I also want to utilize the flex-box property more often for more complicated visual designs in the future.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me to understand CSS flex-box and its varying properties. I would like to use this more in the future.
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-div-width-to-fit-content-using-css/) - This example code gave me a good idea of what my code should look like and how I should format my container to adjust for the image and text inside.
